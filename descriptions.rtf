It was an awful day to go out and shoot but that's when you usually find the drama. Black & white colors in this composition intensifies the poor weather and makes the dead pine stand out from the mist. This view could be from a horror movie and makes you want to wrap up in blankets with hot chocolate and good book.\

Bunch of luck was required to achieve this composition. I had set my exposure at 30 seconds but it would have been nothing without the smoke from the campfire. Smoke made for a perfectly smooth canvas for the fire to paint it during that exposure. Metal rack and hook adds the final touch with nice contrast to it.\

This composition consists of two separate exposures. One before the sunset and one after. First one was to get the colors and brightness and the second one was solely to bring out the light coming from the tent and to add some contrast to overall look. This would have been impossible without a tripod. And some patience.\

Getting up early in the morning, grabbing your camera gear and going to a location is always a gamble. You either get a good image or you don't.

This was taken during my first, a two night, solo hike at Repovesi. Setting up the tripod for a nice composition with right focus was little tricky. Not to mention that ten seconds for a self-timer is a pretty short time when you have to run with a heavy backpack and find that right pose in time. Grey sky makes it look pretty dramatic even though it was absolutely beautiful view from up there.\

This was a fun little project during our hike in the national park of Repovesi. All we needed was a flashlight, straight path and dim evening. Also tripod came handy with long exposure. All in all image turned out pretty good though the forest in the background could have been smoother and covered by snow. Also, maybe some Alan Wake vibes in this one?\

We were already headed back to our car when this view opened up and offered an image that I wasn't expecting to get. Flowing water had kept the water open but it was finally starting to freeze and thin layer of ice made it look crystal clear and flat. It was also snowing which added the smoothness to overall feeling with nice little details against darker parts of the image while also fading the background into nothingness. Post-processing this beauty was an easy task.\

Interesting architecture here and top of the tower offers stunning view over the national park of Repovesi. It was a cloudy day but this wooden structure against the grey sky makes a nice contrast.

It would have been nice if sunrise had painted the wall of Olhava with warm colors but unfortunately it was too cloudy for that to happen. However, it was absolutely still and the reflection in the lake is almost surreal. You could almost flip it upside down and have trouble telling which is which. You might also want to know that this particular wall is the tallest climbing wall in Finland.\

It was a Sunday morning but the alarm had been set to 5:30 am. Going out early and staying out late is definitely one of the biggest challenges for a landscape photographer but those are also the most rewarding moments. Usually they are the only times of the day when magical conditions appear. Excluding moments before and after the storm. This was no exception. Visibility was less than 50 meters and even though there wasn't any light, it was almost surreal scenery at the shore.\

Imagine that this little pine is growing on vertical solid rock with almost no space for its roots. It definitely takes persistence to grown in a place like this and one can't help but admire. One a side note, achieving this composition was little risky as there was over 70m vertical drop to water right in front of my feet. \

Last rays of light painted the clouds pink and you could even see some stars at the sky. It was a quiet and beautiful evening and after some time sky had cleared even more. These kind of views always guarantee a good mood.\

Nature offers stunning light shows from time to time. This was one those times. Sun had already dipped behind the horizon so there was only pink and purple colors left to bend from behind the horizon while the skyline still shone bright. Water would have been a nice surface for reflections but snow isn't that bad either.\

Those rocks and calm surface of the water combined with bright yellow colors makes up a good contrast. Luckily there was a pretty long platform which made this composition possible. Wonder how long those rocks have been lying there.\

Sun was about to set and scenery was very warm with smooth colors. Snow and ice are also looking pretty crisp. Sometimes it's better to leave colors as they were as too much saturation wouldn't deliver the same atmosphere.\

It wasn't the coldest day but the wind made snow cut through the landscape in almost horizontal direction and it was getting harder to move without skis or snowshoes. Grey skies didn't really offer any color to this and therefore black & white makes this look better, bringing out the contrast. Also, that small pile of rocks brings nice interest to foreground and fits well with the overall atmosphere.\

It was the coldest day of the year and even though temperature had risen a bit towards the evening, it was still freezing. Temperature had been as low as minus 26 celsius earlier that day. Cold temperature made air and sky crystal clear and sunset offered nice smooth colors even though there wasn't any clouds to reflect on. That platform on the foreground works as a great leading line to the purple horizon and moon.\

Can you guess what it is in this image? It's a surface of the ice shot from directly above. Water was barely frozen and it had formed those mysterious patterns in it. Snowfall adds a lot of detail to it and makes it look little bit like some galaxy. Colors were an artistic touch to it during the post-processing.\

Visibility was barely enough to get the whole bridge in the image. Morning mist brings great atmosphere to the image and fades the background smoothly into nothingness. The function of this bridge is probably more for the art purposes rather than actually protecting anything from waves. But it's looking nice there so why not. \

In the middle of Helsinki there is a place called Seurasaari where you can get yourself close to the nature. It was a beautiful and quiet evening but finding the right composition wasn't too easy as the sunset itself wasn't enough to make it. Fortunately there was this beautiful shoreline with rocks built in interesting shapes to work as leading lines and foreground interest. Smooth surface of the sea and sunset are what fulfills the image.\

This was one of most colorful sunsets of the year with just the perfect amount of clouds in the sky, forming stunning patterns. There was a delicate wind blowing but with little longer exposure you could turn water into smooth surface with wet rocks in the foreground adding a nice interest to it. All in all it doesn't have that much content but still it's pretty massive. \

When the vertical composition would be just too obvious choice. Horizontal composition highlights the symmetry of the bridge even more and offers a fresh perspective to it. Another important choice was to go with black and white theme as the colors would have drawn the attention away from the bridge and the depth of the image. If you ever go to the national park of Repovesi, this is one of the most iconic places there and you should definitely go check it out.\

Was not expecting any company. It was a freezing cold morning just before the sunrise and these two swans show up. Long zoom would have been handy but the atmosphere was so beautiful and calm that even the moderate shot of these two beautiful animals made an nice image. Pieces of ice floating in the foreground is a concrete proof that it has been cold lately.\

The wall of Olhava is over 70 meters tall and rising high in almost vertical direction. Standing beneath the wall makes you feel small and with this composition it definitely looks massive. Black and white colors brings out the contrast and details in the wall nicely. Placement of these two guys puts everything to new perspective and cropping on top of the images leaves you wondering how tall the wall actually is.\

These built paths in the national park of Nuuksio definitely makes the hiking a pleasure. Almost too easy to walk on. Tripod with self-timer was the trick in this one although getting to focus right wasn't too easy. It was a sunny and warm day and you can sense it from the colors in the background. Wooden path also works as a great leading line keeping the attention in the middle of the image.\

Even though dead it's still very majestic and branches against the sky makes a great contrast with a lot detail. Colors in the original were warm and smooth but they draw the attention away from the grey trunk of the tree so black and white colors helped to pop it out more. If you look very closely, you can see another photographer in this image. Can you spot him?\

Have you heard 'Animals' LP from Pink Floyd? It was a funny coincidence but that this actually looks like a modern day version of 'Animals' cover art and two days afterwards this photo was taken it was 40 year anniversary of that particular album. Setting sun paints those building in Keilaniemi golden while also lightening the sea covered by layers of ice and snow. Colors in the sky aren't bad either so all in all it's pretty nice image. Combining smooth colors and hard edges there and there it almost resembles a painting.\

You probably thought that there are no deserts in Finland? Think again. It was snowing so much that it limited visibility to less than 50 meters. Everything was covered in white and that particularly made this composition possible. There's nothing to it yet there's a lot to it. All the attention being focused on that tiny island makes it a pleasure to watch. Conditions were so perfect for this composition that it needed next to none post-processing.\

We were headed to the suspension bridge of Lapinsalmi when it started snowing. Sun peaking through thick layers of clouds combined with snowfall offered a possibility for very atmospheric photo. Though colors in this composition were little distracting and black and white colors made better justice to the overall feeling of it. Fast exposure guaranteed hikers to stay sharp and the sense of movement is there as well. Even though they are barely visible, those tracks of previous hikers and skiers work as a leading lines towards the setting sun and horizon. \

Finding high ground with an open view was quite a challenge as the sun was setting quickly. We were about to give up when we realized there was this narrow view to the horizon and with right placement of the model it brings the much needed interest to the image. Thin layer of snow on top of the backpack adds a nice touch to the overall feeling with right amount of detail. This could work as an advertisement photo for some outdoor company.\

Nature blessed us with a clear sky and sunshine and even though it didn't last long, it was enough for this shot. Direct sunlight would have melted the snow on top of those trees but luckily they were mostly in shadows. It might look like it's snowing but actually that's not the case. Particles flying in the cold the wind made it possible for light to reflect on them. However, to catch the view, very fast exposure was required. All in all this view could be from top of the wall from Game of Thrones. Mystical and beautiful. \

Lake was absolutely crystal clear with no whisper of wind nearby but what took the attention was the contrast of that rock and yellow leafs of that birch. It was a cloudy day so there's not any shadows forming against the rocks which actually helps with bringing out the contrast of the birch. It's amazing how bright colors leafs can take during the fall and this one was probably at its most colorful days. On the right side theres another birch with no leafs left so even though it's an distracting element, it fades to the background pretty smoothly. Reflections on the lake add a final touch to the image.\
